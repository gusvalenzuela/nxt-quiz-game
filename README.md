- Still a work in progress.
- See and play with QuizDown V2.0 [here](https://quiz-down.herokuapp.com/).

## Description:

Timed quiz with penalty for wrong answers and points added to your final score for correct ones.

## How to Play:

- Choose from one of over 20 categories! Select a difficulty and click PLAY to begin.
- Or, if you're feeling spicy, click on one of the 3 available difficulties to select a category at random.
- A timer will begin and a series of questions will be asked. Answer correctly and you'll be rewarded with points added to your score. Get it wrong and you lose points! So choose carefully. And watch the clock, once it runs out the choices are disabled and you will be awarded 0 points (womp womp). So hurry!
- Have fun!
